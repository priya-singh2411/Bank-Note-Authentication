# Bank-Note-Authentication
## About:
  <p>
    Genuine Dataset obtained from UCI ML Repository dataset. Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an     industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. 
    The objective of this project is to predict whether the Note is genuine or not based upon the features. I have used Random Forest Classifier as the prediction model over the data provided by Kaggle.
